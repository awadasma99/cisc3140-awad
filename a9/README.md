To run this locally, you need to acquire an API key for the RAWG Video Games Database, which can be done via RAWG's
official site or through an API Marketplace that includes RAWG Video Games Database, then enter it on lines 8 and 31 of the source code. 

The app, written in Python, utilizes RAWG's API by accessing a list of games— each of which has information pertaining to the game such as ratings, player count, etc.— as well as a list of genres provided by RAWG. Using the genre subcategory, the app returns a list of games that fall under the user-specified genre in the form of an HTML webpage. 

When the program is run, the app lists the genres and prompts the user to choose one by entering its corresponding number. It then notifies the user if games were registered under that genre by providing the name of the HTML file that the user can open in a browser. Otherwise, if no games were found, it notifies the user accordingly. As an example, I entered 0 via the command line, which pertains to the "Action" genre, and the program generated what is in the "games.html" file. I've also provided a screenshot of the HTML page as a quicker way to visualize the output of the program, if preferred, as well.
