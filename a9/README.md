To run this locally, you need to acquire an API key for the RAWG Video Games Database, which can be done via RAWG's
official site or through an API Marketplace that includes RAWG Video Games Database. 

The app utilizes RAWG's API by accessing a list of games, each of which has information pertaining to the game such as 
ratings, stores the game is sold in, etc., as well as a list of genres provided by RAWG. 

The user chooses a genre by number as listed by the program, and the program creates an HTML webpage listing all games that 
are provided by RAWG in that category. In the provided HTML file, I entered 0, pertaining to the "Action" genre to 
serve as an example of how the HTML file is formatted by the program.
