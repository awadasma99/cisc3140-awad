Assignment 10 

For this assignment, three main files are included:
  (1) a log from Travis CI demonstrating the successful build/deployment message, tested in a separate repository (log_travis) 
  (2) the yaml file created in order to be read by Travis CI (.travis.yml) 
  (3) a screenshot of the deployed app on heroku, URL displayed (heroku_app_deploy.png)

Requirements related files are referenced by the yaml file, therefore they have been included as well.
